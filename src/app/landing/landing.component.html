            <h2>What is SAKILA CTX?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>SAKILA CTX</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open-source</strong> <strong>Web API</strong> designed to simulate the operations of a modern <strong>movie rental platform</strong>, providing a rich environment that replicates the typical functionality of renting, managing, and tracking films and user activity. 
                It offers complete flows for <strong>film rentals</strong>, <strong>user account management</strong>, <strong>staff role configuration</strong>, and <strong>actor registration</strong>, making it suitable both for testing and educational purposes. 
                Additionally, it provides a detailed simulation of a real-world backend, including <strong>authentication systems</strong>, <strong>user authorization</strong>, <strong>data collection</strong>, <strong>analytics</strong>, and <strong>administrative controls</strong>. 
                The API is fully operational under the base address <code>{{API_URL}}</code>, where all <strong>endpoints</strong> can be accessed and tested. 
                You can explore the full source code and contribute to its development by visiting the public GitHub repository linked below.

            <h2>What is the purpose of SAKILA CTX?</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of <strong>SAKILA CTX</strong> is to serve as a comprehensive <strong>best-practice framework</strong> for exploring and learning how a complete API-driven architecture functions. 
                It allows developers to experiment with an existing <strong>microservice-style architecture</strong>, interact with <strong>RESTful endpoints</strong>, and understand the core principles of <strong>API development</strong> and <strong>resource modeling</strong>. 
                As an <strong>educational resource</strong>, it offers a full working example of <strong>API design</strong>, including elements such as <strong>controllers</strong>, <strong>service layers</strong>, and <strong>data persistence strategies</strong>. 
                Furthermore, being <strong>open source</strong>, it provides transparency into the implementation of modern development techniques, including <strong>middleware use</strong>, <strong>error handling</strong>, and <strong>performance tuning</strong>. 
                This makes it ideal for both beginners and advanced users who want to examine how a scalable API works internally.

            <h2>How can I start using SAKILA CTX?</h2>
            <p>
                Getting started with <strong>SAKILA CTX</strong> is simple thanks to its extensive <strong>documentation</strong> and clearly defined <strong>endpoint structure</strong>. 
                The documentation explains how to handle <strong>authentication tokens</strong>, construct <strong>HTTP requests</strong>, define <strong>request bodies</strong>, set <strong>required headers</strong>, and interpret <strong>standardized responses</strong>. 
                It follows a <strong>controller-action design pattern</strong>, which organizes related operations under clearly named endpoints and sub-actions. 
                The API also includes details on common response errors and their causes, such as <strong>CORS restrictions</strong>, <strong>rate limits</strong>, <strong>timeout issues</strong>, and <strong>request validation errors</strong>. 
                You’ll find guidance on how to interact with all the functionality exposed by the backend via <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. 
                This address differs from the UI-based application typically hosted at <code>{{FRONT_URL}}</code>, which consumes the API as its backend. 
                Full usage details, including examples and troubleshooting advice, are available at the link below.
